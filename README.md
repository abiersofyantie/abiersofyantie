## 🌼&nbsp;***About me***
<p align="justify">I am an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student at  Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya (EEPIS). a passionate UI/UX designer with a keen eye for detail and a knack for creating seamless, user-centric experiences. My mission is to bridge the gap between aesthetic appeal and functional design, crafting interfaces that not only look stunning but also elevate the user's journey. I love to learn and build something new, productive, innovative and creative. </p>

**I am interested in Web designing, Product Owner, and Quality Assurance**
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
- ✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help, only if the ball is in my court!😉<br>
- Outside tech, 📖 I love to read novels, 🖌️ do painting and skecthing, 🎵 listen to music, and 🌴 explore nature outdoors.
